# MVVM

This project is a simplified demonstration of a **WPF application using the MVVM design pattern**, featuring a **login dialog** with the following functionality:

- Username and password input fields
- Toggle password visibility with an eye icon
- Dialog-based interaction using Prism's `IDialogAware` interface
- Basic input validation and simulated login flow
- Visibility management for Cancel and Work Offline buttons

This project is created for demonstration purposes as part of a portfolio submission.

## Features

- **MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns using ViewModels, Views, and data binding
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Secure UX feature allowing users to view/hide their password

## Technologies Used

- WPF (.NET 6+)
- C#
- MVVM with [Prism]
- XAML for UI
- Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

Due to **copyright and NDA restrictions**, some parts of the original source code (e.g., namespaces, internal module references, and certain class names) have been replaced with placeholder identifiers like `[Redacted]`. 
The functionality and structure remain intact to demonstrate architectural and coding style.
